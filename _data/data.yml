career-profile:
    title: Background
    summary: |
      I am an evolutionary biologist interested in obligate arthropod symbionts. 
      Although BSc specialized in biochemistry, as a graduate student, I am learning 
      to approach biological questions from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, 
      by utilizing many molecular biology methods learned as an undergraduate student, 
      as well as expanding my skillsets in field work and computer programming to 
      analyze hundreds of sequencing data on HPC.

      - role: <strong>Doctoral Research Student/ JSPS DC1 Fellow</strong>
        time: 2020-present
        company: Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University <br> Integrative Community Ecology Unit, Okinawa, Japan
        details: |
          <b>Research Group:</b> Prof. David Armitage <br>
            - Collected 500+ _Darlingtonia californica_ plant samples, _Metriocnemus edwardsi_ 
            larvae and _Sarraceniopus darlingtoniae_ mites from 50+ sites, extracted DNA from all samples, 
            and sequenced ~200 plant samples (ddRADSeq) and all arthropod samples (COI amplicon).    
            - Analyzing sequencing data for population genetics and landscape ecology. 
            - Was invited for a poster presentation at the Tohoku University - OIST 3<sup>rd</sup> joint 
            workshop on biodiveristy 2022. 
      - role: <strong>Visiting Researcher</strong>

        company: Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University <br> Ecology and Evolution Unit, Okinawa, Japan
        details: |
          **Research Group:** Prof. Alexander (Sasha) Mikheyev <br>
            - Created an RNA library of 200+ global Varroa mite collection to unravel honeybee viruses'
            history as a biogeographical map, and found that contrary to previous reports, Deformed wing
            virus A originates in Asia, not Europe (see Hasegawa _et al._ 2023, below). 
            - Developed a novel method for Varroa mite storage conditions for field working and 
            beekeeping collaborators (see Hasegawa _et al._ 2021, below). 
            - Developed a novel method for single Varroa mite DNA & RNA extraction for next generation sequencing
            (see Hasegawa _et al._ 2021, below).

            - Hired full time for 8 months under the Natural Sciences and Enginrring Research Council of Canada grant 
            shared between Prof. Merrill and Prof. Ernesto Guzman-Novoa (School of Environmental Sciences, University of Guelph), 
            partly working towards BSc thesis titled "Efficacy of plant tinctures against _Paenibacillus larvae_, a causative 
            agent of American foulbrood in _Apis mellifera_". 
            - Extended 4 months as a thesis student (unpaid), designed and conducted _in vitro_ rearing of honey bee larvae
            to test for antimicrobial effects of natural plant tinctures against _P. larvae_. Screened >50 tinctures and 
            found several plant derived tinctures that mitigate _P. larvae_ growth on agarose media with low minimum
            inhibitory concentrations.
            - Successfully met criteria, submitted thesis, and defended an oral exam for BSc thesis. 
            - Supervised summer research student and aided in lab managaement & bee rearing as a part time 
            lab assistant for the final 4 months of the total of 16 month period with this research group.

            - Led a side project alongside a postdoctoral-fellow on mhoney bee sample preservation methods for downstream proteomics analysis.
            - Processed over 1200 samples (dissection, protein extraction, quantification, digestion, and methyl labelling). 
            - Supervised and instructured summer intern students to work on above project. 
            - Demonstrated applications of high throughput technology (mass spectrometry) at the BC tech summit 2017.
