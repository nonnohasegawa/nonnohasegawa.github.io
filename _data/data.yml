career-profile:
    title: Background
    summary: |
      I am an evolutionary biologist interested in obligate arthropod symbionts. 
      Although BSc specialized in biochemistry, as a graduate student, I am learning 
      to approach biological questions from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, 
      by utilizing many molecular biology methods learned as an undergraduate student, 
      as well as expanding my skillsets in field work and computer programming to 
      analyze hundreds of sequencing data on HPC.

            - Collected 500+ _Darlingtonia californica_ plant samples, _Metriocnemus edwardsi_ 
            larvae and _Sarraceniopus darlingtoniae_ mites from 50+ sites, extracted DNA from all samples, 
            and sequenced ~200 plant samples (ddRADSeq) and all arthropod samples (COI amplicon).    
            - Analyzing sequencing data for population genetics and landscape ecology. 
            - Was invited for a poster presentation at the Tohoku University - OIST 3<sup>rd</sup> joint 
            workshop on biodiveristy 2022.

          **Research Group:** Prof. Alexander (Sasha) Mikheyev <br>
            - Created an RNA library of 200+ global Varroa mite collection to unravel honeybee viruses'
            history as a biogeographical map, and found that contrary to previous reports, Deformed wing
            virus A originates in Asia, not Europe (see Hasegawa _et al._ 2023, below). 
            - Developed a novel method for Varroa mite storage conditions for field working and 
            beekeeping collaborators (see Hasegawa _et al._ 2021, below). 
            - Developed a novel method for single Varroa mite DNA & RNA extraction for next generation sequencing
            (see Hasegawa _et al._ 2021, below).

            partly working towards BSc thesis titled "Efficacy of plant tinctures against _Paenibacillus larvae_, a causative 
            agent of American foulbrood in _Apis mellifera_". 
            - Extended 4 months as a thesis student (unpaid), designed and conducted _in vitro_ rearing of honey bee larvae
            to test for antimicrobial effects of natural plant tinctures against _P. larvae_. Screened >50 tinctures and 
            found several plant derived tinctures that mitigate _P. larvae_ growth on agarose media with low minimum
            inhibitory concentrations.
            - Successfully met criteria, submitted thesis, and defended an oral exam for BSc thesis. 
            - Supervised summer research student and aided in lab managaement & bee rearing as a part time
